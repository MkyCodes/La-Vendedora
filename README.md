SmartList - TO DO , NOTES APP 
ALX Software Engineering Graduation Project.

The project is about the implementation of a simple web application that allows users to manage their to-do list and notes. 
The frontend will provide a user interface for adding, editing, and deleting to-do items and notes, 
while the backend will handle the storage and retrieval of data.

The project will be implemented using the following technologies:

    React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Django: A high-level Python web framework for building web applications.
    Django REST framework: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
    SQLite: A lightweight database engine used for storing data.

The project will be structured as follows:

    frontend/: Contains the React application for the frontend.
    backend/: Contains the Django application for the backend.
    README.md: Contains the project documentation.
    requirements.txt: Contains the Python dependencies for the project.
    package.json: Contains the JavaScript dependencies for the project.

The project will be implemented in the following steps:

    Step 1: Set up the project structure.
    Step 2: Implement the login and registration functionality.
    Step 3: Implement the to-do list management functionality.
    Step 4: Implement the notes management functionality.
    Step 5: Implement the API integration.
    Step 6: Deploy the application.

IMPORTANT POINTS 

The project will be divided into parts: 

   1 login and registration,
   
        login system for users to access their to-do list and notes. 
            frontend will provide a form for users to enter their username and password,
            backend will handle the authentication and authorization of users.


   2 to-do list management,

        frontend will provide a user interface for adding, editing, and deleting to-do items,
        backend will handle the storage and retrieval of to-do items.

   3 notes management,

        frontend will provide a user interface for adding, editing, and deleting notes,
        backend will handle the storage and retrieval of notes.

   4 API integration,

        frontend will interact with the backend using RESTful APIs to manage to-do items and notes.

   5 Testing,

        test the application using unit testing 

   6 deployment.

        deploy the application to a server so that users can access it over the internet.

Working Sequence 

1. Set up the project structure: 
    - Create a new directory for the project.
    - Inside the project directory, create two subdirectories: `frontend` and `backend`.
    - Initialize a new React application in the `frontend` directory.
    - Initialize a new Django application in the `backend` directory.
    - Create a `README.md` file in the project directory.
    - Create a `requirements.txt` file in the `backend` directory.
    - Create a `package.json` file in the `frontend` directory.

2. Implement the login and registration functionality: 
    - Frontend:
        - Create a login form with fields for username and password.
        - Create a registration form with fields for username, email, and password.
        - Implement form validation and error handling.
        - Implement API calls to the backend for login and registration.
    - Backend:
        - Set up Django authentication and authorization.
        - Create API endpoints for user registration and login.
        - Implement user authentication and token generation.

3. Implement the to-do list management functionality: 
    - Frontend:
        - Create a user interface for displaying the to-do list.
        - Implement functionality for adding new to-do items.
        - Implement functionality for editing existing to-do items.
        - Implement functionality for deleting to-do items.
        - Implement API calls to the backend for managing to-do items.
    - Backend:
        - Create models for to-do items.
        - Create API endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting to-do items.
        - Implement functionality for storing and retrieving to-do items from the database.

4. Implement the notes management functionality: 
    - Frontend:
        - Create a user interface for displaying notes.
        - Implement functionality for adding new notes.
        - Implement functionality for editing existing notes.
        - Implement functionality for deleting notes.
        - Implement API calls to the backend for managing notes.
    - Backend:
        - Create models for notes.
        - Create API endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting notes.
        - Implement functionality for storing and retrieving notes from the database.
 
5. Implement the API integration: 
    - Frontend:
        - Implement API calls to the backend for user authentication, to-do list management, and notes management.
        - Handle API responses and update the user interface accordingly.
    - Backend:
        - Ensure that all API endpoints are properly secured and authenticated.
        - Implement error handling and validation for API requests.

6. Testing:  
    - Frontend:
        - Write unit tests for React components.
        - Write integration tests for API calls.
    - Backend:
        - Write unit tests for Django models and views.
        - Write integration tests for API endpoints.

7. Deployment && Make the Video : 
    - Set up a production server for hosting the application.
    - Configure the server to run the Django backend and serve the React frontend.
    - Deploy the application to the server.
    - Ensure that the application is accessible over the internet.
    - Implement any necessary security measures, such as HTTPS and firewall rules.
